            <p><em>no frameworks or libraries are to be used</em> - speaks for itself for the most part. I will also
                assume no other software such as dreamweaver can be used either.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sitepoint - done
                <li>Doing Stuff with Web Things - downloaded</li>
                <li>Chrome - already installed</li>
                <li>Git (Github) - set up.</li>
                <li>Vs Code - already installed (added exts required for the class</li>
                <li>Brackets sounds interesting, should check it out...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Course is divided into 2 blocks - 2 section each (Exploration and Challenge)<br>Not sure what I could use
                as a programming challenge based on this description. Hopefully it will become clear and something will
                present itself.</p>
            <p>Should meet with my team every week...</p>

            <p><em>localstorage</em> is an easy way to store key-value pairs on the user's system.<br>
                Format is simple:<br>
                Store: localStorage.setItem(key, value);<br>
                Retrieve: variable = localStorage.getItem(key);<br>
                Values can only be strings, but I bet using JSON will work to store other types of objects.

                        guide!</a></em>
            </p>
            <p><em>Master Mobile UX</em><br>
                Mobile retrofitting vs Mobile first (I have always done the former)<br>
                Mobile is important. And that's all video 1 seems to demonstrate. I am not convinced about the paradigm
                yet.<br>
                People want things fast and easy - it's obvious. His statistics and examples are out of date though in
                my opinion.
                His comments about simplifying forms and the user experience with those are very good.
